Challenges:
1. How to get the information of the menu on the client side. I tried to put the request instructions into the request_headers, whihc would also be cached to the Client side when a connection was set.
2. How to print the messages in order. Cause I am not that familiar with Python dictionary, it takes a bit of time.
3. Create the UDP socket on the client side to receive direct message. Using multithreading to receive messages.
